FilmAffinity based web application built with java, microservices architecture, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Eureka and Cloud Gateway; in addition to MySQL databases for the microservices.

Here is a [DEMO Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7moXJkMgZ-Q) if you want to see the full operation of the application.

## Execution

### Microservices
> [!NOTE]
> To run each microservice, it is recommended to open each folder in a java IDE (e.g. [IntellijIDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)), except for `bdd` and run each one from there.

### DB

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have installed [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

Inside the `bdd/` folder there is an `.sql` script wich creates the databases needed.
